# Recurse center: W1D2

Here are some things we did today during my first on-site day at the Recurse hub!

1. Learn by commute from UWS down to the Recurse Hub in downtown Brooklyn
1. Got a tour of the facilities
1. Socialized and met other folks in the batch over ü•Ø ‚òïÔ∏è
1. Did a code pairing workshop -- wrote a Conway's game of life implementation as a pair via React/NextJS with [freeman-jiang](https://github.com/freeman-jiang) ([source code](https://github.com/etgrieco/recurse-cgol) and [deployed web app](https://conway.freemanjiang.com/))
    - Was *incredibly* intrigued by a novel implementation using [typest](https://typst.app/) with PDF outputs as 'steps' in the game of life
1. Built this blog with this basic static site generation tool [11ty](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/) -- thanks [Paloma](https://palomakop.tv/) for pointing me in the right direction, there!
    - Also learned some basics of leveraging GH actions for some build/deploy steps (commit -> update blog will keep this sustainable!)
1. Started some course browsing for getting started to code tomorrow. Considering:
    - [The last algorithms course you'll need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/), [introduction to algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020/pages/calendar/), and [computer graphics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-837-computer-graphics-fall-2012/)
    - thinking through if there's a way to start on a prototype game soon enough as a jumping off point to learn and implement these kinds of thigns
    - if not 'the game', then at least some web thingd demonstrating some 'what I learned' in a fun, interactive way!

Anyway, this day flew by and I had fun putting out at least a bit of code through the pairing experience! ‚úåÔ∏è
